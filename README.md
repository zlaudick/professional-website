## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work here. I like your emphasis on Web Application Security - that's definitely an aspect of your training worth featuring. Your Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona and Use Case are all sufficiently detailed enough to give you a good start. Since this project is part of your professional portfolio, it's got to look fantastic on both mobile and LARGE desktops (30 inch cinema displays) to demonstrate that you know how to create a slick, responsive front-end. Your HTML is excellent, and your directory structure is spot on. Nice job.
