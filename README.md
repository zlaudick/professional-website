## PWP Milestone 1 Feedback
Nice work here. I like your emphasis on Web Application Security - that's definitely an aspect of your training worth featuring. Your Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona and Use Case are all sufficiently detailed enough to give you a good start. Since this project is part of your professional portfolio, it's got to look fantastic on both mobile and LARGE desktops (30 inch cinema displays) to demonstrate that you know how to create a slick, responsive front-end. Your HTML is excellent, and your directory structure is spot on. Nice job.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

## PWP Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Nice work - I like the concise scope here. Your wireframes, content strategy and site map are all well done, and it's clear you have a well-defined direction and vision for your project. Looking forward to seeing your site take shape.

Think in detail about how you would would like your portfolio items laid out, and how that grid will work. Take a look at [Bootstrap's Thumbnails](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#thumbnails). They may or may not work for your layout - but the HTML structure may be helpful to observe.

Explore the [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) library if you would like to create some hover effects over gallery tiles.

There are plenty of mobile-friendly, responsive, jQuery-driven "lightbox" gallery plugins out there that you can use for your Portfolio section too. Here are a few:
- [Swipebox](http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/)
- [Lightbox](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/)
- [Fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/)

I suggest giving the [Bootstrap Challenge](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/~rlewis37/bootstrap-practice/) a shot. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric) You are clear to begin development on your PWP.
